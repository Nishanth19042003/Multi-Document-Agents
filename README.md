# Multi-Document Agents
The Multi-Document Agents project introduces an intelligent system capable of interacting with multiple documents simultaneously, designed to meet the increasing demands for efficient, scalable, and context-aware document analysis. This project leverages modern AI technologies to extract, process, and synthesize insights from large collections of documents, allowing users to query and retrieve information seamlessly.

Key innovations include the use of agent-based architectures, which enable modular workflows where independent agents handle distinct tasks like retrieval, summarization, and query processing. The system is particularly useful for domains like research, business intelligence, and education, where handling and making sense of large document collections is critical.
